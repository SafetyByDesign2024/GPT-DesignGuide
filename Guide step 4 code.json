				"Location": "Passo del Bocco descent, Giro d'Italia, Italy",
				"Victim": {
					"Name": "Wouter Weylandt",
					"Profession": "Professional Cyclist",
					"Nationality": "Belgium"
				},	
				"Incident Description": {
					"Summary": "Wouter Weylandt was descending a mountain pass at high speed during the race.",
					"Details": [
						"He lost control of his bike on a turn, leading to a severe crash.",
						"The impact resulted in fatal injuries, including skull fractures and massive internal bleeding."
					]
