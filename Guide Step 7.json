      "AspectsToConsider": [
        {
          "Aspect": "Consider the Environment of the System (Technological Environment)",
          "WhatItMeans": "The system's design must account for the technological environment in which it operates, including external systems, regulatory standards, and environmental factors like weather or physical space.",
          "Example": "In designing a smart grid, the system must integrate seamlessly with existing power infrastructure and comply with energy safety standards, ensuring overload protection and continuity during outages."
        },
        {
          "Aspect": "Design the Layout of Subsystems and Component Interfaces",
          "WhatItMeans": "The system design should ensure that subsystems are arranged properly, with clear interfaces between them. These interfaces should function efficiently and safely, facilitating smooth interaction between components.",
          "Example": "In a car braking system, subsystems such as the pedal, hydraulic lines, and calipers must interact without error. The interface between the pedal and the hydraulic system must ensure the brake functions promptly when pressed."
        },
        {
          "Aspect": "Design Components and Subsystem Interfaces",
          "WhatItMeans": "Each subsystem and its components must be designed to meet functional and safety requirements. This includes ensuring that interfaces between the components of each subsystem are secure and that each component operates reliably.",
          "Example": "In aircraft navigation, subsystems like communication and navigation must interface efficiently, ensuring that communication delays do not affect flight data transmission."
        },
        {
          "Aspect": "Plan for Future Wear and Replacement",
          "WhatItMeans": "The design must account for the wear and tear of components over time, ensuring that they can be easily replaced or upgraded. The system should also be adaptable to future technological advances or changes in user needs.",
          "Example": "In a wind turbine, components like rotor blades or gearboxes must be designed for easy replacement, reducing downtime during maintenance. The design should also allow for integration of future efficiency improvements."

      "Suggestions": [
        {
          "Suggestion": "Learn from Legacy Systems and Unidentified Hazards",
          "WhatItMeans": "Reviewing legacy systems and identifying previously undetected hazards can improve the current design. Learning from past experiences helps avoid repeating mistakes and incorporates proven solutions into the design process.",
          "Example": "When designing a new nuclear control system, lessons from previous systems can reveal security vulnerabilities or performance bottlenecks, leading to a safer design."
